  <h1>Advent of Code 2023</h1>
  <p>A set of solutions for Advent of Code 2023 written in Rust.</p>
</div>

### Preface

This is my second time participating in Advent of Code. While I chose Rust last year (as I was learning it), I decided to use Bun to write this year's solutions in TypeScript. All solutions have been tested against the puzzle inputs provided to my account on the Advent of Code website. As per the [About](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about) page, the puzzle text and inputs are not included in this repository.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed on your machine.

### Inputs

The inputs for each day should be stored in an `inputs` directory in the root of the project. Each file is named after the day it corresponds to. For example, the input for day 1 is stored in `inputs/day1.txt`. The inputs can be retrieved from [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

### Running the Program

Your first step is to install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run a solution, you need to run the corresponding file in the `solutions` directory. For example, to run the solution for day 1, you would run `bun run solutions/day1.ts`.

```bash
bun run solutions/day1.ts
```
